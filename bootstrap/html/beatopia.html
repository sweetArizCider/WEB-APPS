                            Written by beabadoobee</strong> “Beatopia Cultsong” was very spontaneous. It was created on a night where me and Jacob invited Soren and Molly to the studio, and Jacob had decided to record the whole night, even our conversations. If you listen closely, mine and Molly’s conversations are in the background, pitched up. The words we’re actually saying encapsulated what we felt at the time, it was just like, out of isolation we were really confused, and it felt like time was moving in slow motion.

                            Written by beabadoobee</strong>With a bedroom pop and indie rock sound and insanely catchy production, “10:36” serves as a perfect summer track to live out all of your early 2000s coming-of-age movie dreams.

                            “10:36” captures the intense and specific feelings that come with loneliness and love; dropping back to a soft vocal line over a single guitar, beabadobee repeats, “I know you thought it was just us / I didn’t think you’d fall in love / You’re just a warm body to hold / At night when I’m feeling all alone,” sharing that while she gets comfort from being with this person at night, there’s nothing deeper in this relationship for her.
                            
                            Although harsh to hear, beabadoobee stunningly encapsulates these specific and crushing feelings from both her perspective and the experience of an unrequited lover.
                            
                            “10:36” is a thrilling taste of Beatopia, which is set to bring listeners into the world and imagination of seven-year-old beabadoobee through a distinctive mix of bedroom pop, fuzzy rock, and psychedelia.

                            Written by Joseph Rodgers, Pete Robertson</strong>The third track of Beatopia, Sunny Day has an appropriately summery feel, channeling retro vibes as Bea sings about reconnecting with friends after a period of rainy weather.

                            Beabadoobee once states in a press release:
                            
                            Sunny Day is a song that I’ve always wanted to make but something that I’ve never done before. Putting it on Beatopia was quite nerve-wracking for me but I’m glad I did. We had written it during a week of crazy productivity in terms of creating songs. I had a session with Starsmith and the song just flowed naturally. I love it.

                                Written by Pete Robertson, Joseph Rodgers</strong>“Ripples” is a folk-inspired song about finding yourself again after being away from people you love. After the success of Fake It Flowers, Bea went on tour alone, away from her friends and former boyfriend Soren. During this time of isolation, Bea took time to reflect on herself and her relationships and had some songwriting help from lead singer Matthew Healy of The 1975.

                                The verses show Bea’s struggle to be emotionally open with her friends after being alone for so long. In the chorus, Bea hints at the codependency she refrains from, a struggle she alludes to later in the album with “Don’t Get the Deal.” The title is an illusion to water ripples and her reflection in the water; these are metaphors of the façade she puts up while around others.

                                on the album. It talks about the same situation in my childhood – how it’s shaped my view in life as a young woman – trust issue
                                s and all that. I don’t think I can sing it live just yet. I mean, we’re not going to be performing live for a while, so I guess I’m prob
                                ably going to get over it by then?” – Bea for i-D

                                In Bea’s Spotify Magazine, she claims “It’s one of the saddest songs on the album. It’s about how your childhood 
                                affects your relationship when you’re older. Like the men in your life and how you view affection.”

                                Written by Joseph Rodgers, Pete Robertson</strong>  <p>“Talk” is an energetic guitar-driven track where beabadoobee describes her regular days where she’d often go out on a Tuesday night when she should remain at home to relax for her midweek duties for the following morning.

                                    On March 23, 2022, she spoke with NME in an interview, where she’s depicted herself opting to enjoy life:
                                    
                                    I wrote ‘Talk’ just after my first album. I was obsessed with Tuesday because I thought it was the best night to go out, not too much chaos but just enough to have a good time. Generally, it’s about doing things that aren’t necessarily healthy or great for you but you can’t help indulging. It’s like that unavoidable feeling that you get, you can’t get rid of it and you know it’s bad but you love it really and it’s whatever, so you do it anyway.
                                    
                                    On March 15, 2022, Bea first teased the instrumental on her Twitter, telling her followers to subscribe to her mailing list to stay up to date on her latest releases:

                                Written by Joseph Rodgers, Pete Robertson</strong> The 1975’s Matty Healy served as a mentor for Bea during the creation of Beatopia, a benefit of her contract with Dirty Hit. Pictures of Us is a reworking of a song written for Healy’s ever-in-limbo solo project “Drive Like I Do,” a reference to one of the band’s many early names.

                                Healy had the song and three others pretty much ready for release, before being sidetracked working on the band’s fifth studio album: Being Funny In A Foreign Language. Because of this Healy offered up one of the songs to Bea. Referencing this in an interview with NME he said:
                                
                                “I have to sit on stuff and then edit it before I love it, by the time I sat on it and started editing it I was making a 75 record and Bea had fallen in love with Pictures Of Us.”
                                
                                Bea took the song and made changes to the pre-chorus, changing the lyrics about Healy’s childhood to those of her own. This portion is written about a girl Bea used to know, and all the crazy things they did together as teenagers. Bea had previously written about this girl on the record “Fake It Flowers”.
