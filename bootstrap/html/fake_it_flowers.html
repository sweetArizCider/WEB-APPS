                            Written by beabadoobee</strong> Bea describes this song as an ‘angry girl anthem’, whe wrote this song when she felt really angry. She was angry about past experiences in her life and how it still affects her to this day. In this song Bea confronts those who have caused her pain, or have failed to listen to her when she needed a shoulder to cry on. It shows beabadoobee’s vulnerability but, on the other hand, it also illustrates her courage and independence.

A friend told me this story, about what was essentially an abusive relationship. And it made me really angry, because this is just something that happens so often these days. At times, I feel like I’ve fallen into that trap, where I feel like I’m only doing things to impress my boyfriend. But every time I sing this song it reminds me that I am my own person, and I can do whatever the fuck I want.“ – Bea for i-D

                            In Bea’s Spotify Magazine, she claims “This song is about horrible men in your life that you may experience – if you’re lucky hopefully you never will. Its about the frustration you feel when you can’t be yourself.”

I wanted it to feel very nostalgic. I’ve never been but I’ve always wanted to go to my boyfriend’s family’s house in France. I’ve seen pictures and it just looks so ethereal but so home-y at the same time? It just seems like a really peaceful place that would heal a lot of things.” – Bea for i-D

                                In Bea’s Spotify Magazine, she claims “This was meant to be on the Space Cadet EP but I held it back for the album. It’s about missing certain times in your life and wishing to go back to where it all started.”.

                                on the album. It talks about the same situation in my childhood – how it’s shaped my view in life as a young woman – trust issue

                                ably going to get over it by then?” – Bea for i-D

                                In Bea’s Spotify Magazine, she claims “It’s one of the saddest songs on the album. It’s about how your childhood

During their years together, they lived a wild, experimental life which included messing with drugs. Such a habit overtook Bea’s friend, so she separated herself from this individual.

                                And even in the present day, the friend is still dealing with this issue. Bea is not only “sorry” for having to excommunicate this person, even though for the most part she still feels a need to do so. But she is also feeling partially to blame, so to speak, for this individual falling into such a trap in the first place.
